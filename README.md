## Summary
In this project, we conclude that the model can predict the type of an URL on the basis of its features. The dataset on which we worked consisted different types of URL, for example- Benign, Phishing, Defacement and Malware. These predictions are done by various Machine learning algorithms which we performed using Python. Among all the algorithms we used, the Gaussian Naive Bayes returned the lowest accuracy value and highest RMSE. Logistic Regression also had comparatively low accuracy score and high RMSE value as this is a classification problem in the first place and don’t go well with regression algorithms.

It was found that the Random Forest Classifier predicted the Highest accuracy rate, 0.965 which also means it had the lowest RMSE value, which makes it the most desired classification algorithm to work upon this huge data set. 


## FUTURE SCOPE

The Malicious URL Prediction model’s efficiency can also increase if we implement some more data into the data set and use different data pre-processing techniques, as the working of a model depends largely upon the quality of the data set that is used while training the model. As the technology is improving, with every passing day it is taking cyber-attacks a step forward. The model’s improved and updated version can be implemented in various browsers and applications which can make the users aware, if found any suspected malicious URL.
